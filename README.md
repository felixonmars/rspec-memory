# RSpec::Memory

Make assertions about memory usage.

[![Development Status](https://github.com/socketry/rspec-memory/workflows/Development/badge.svg)](https://github.com/socketry/rspec-memory/actions?workflow=Development)

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

``` ruby
gem 'rspec-memory'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install rspec-memory

Finally, add this require statement to the top of `spec/spec_helper.rb`

``` ruby
require 'rspec/memory'
```

## Usage

Allocating large amounts of objects can lead to memory problems. `RSpec::Memory` adds a `limit_allocations` matcher, which tracks the number of allocations and memory size for each object type and allows you to specify expected limits.

``` ruby
RSpec.describe "memory allocations" do
	include_context RSpec::Memory
	
	it "limits allocation counts" do
		expect do
			6.times{String.new}
		end.to limit_allocations(String => 10) # 10 strings can be allocated
	end
	
	it "limits allocation counts (hash)" do
		expect do
			6.times{String.new}
		end.to limit_allocations(String => {count: 10}) # 10 strings can be allocated
	end
	
	it "limits allocation size" do
		expect do
			6.times{String.new("foo")}
		end.to limit_allocations(String => {size: 1024}) # 1 KB of strings can be allocated
	end
end
```
